<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I am Eric Cho. I am currently enrolled in CIS 162 mainly to expand my tool box of programming languages. I am fairly proficient in C++ as well as Python and hope to eventually become a system security analyst in the future. I personally find programming fascinating as it allows anyone with just a little know how to create something that can last on the internet. I look forward to learning as much as I can this semester.

<ol>
  <li>I enjoy playing Go</li>
  <li>I spend time on leetcode and programming on personal projects</li>
  <li>Reading</li>
</ol>

<h3>My Goals</h3>

<l>
  <li>To earn my compTIA network+ certification</li>
  <li>To work at a summer internship for software development</li>
  <li>To work in risk compliance in cyber security</li>
</l>

<p>
My favorite web site is <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> because it provides me with all the answers to programming questions I have (usually)
