<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I am Eric Cho. I am currently enrolled in CIS 162 mainly to expand my tool box of programming languages. I am fairly proficient in C++ as well as Python and hope to eventually become a system security analyst in the future. I personally find programming fascinating as it allows anyone with just a little know how to create something that can last on the internet. I look forward to learning as much as I can this semester.
